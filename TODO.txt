[X] - lay the foundation of representing the grid
[X] - set up the math infra to perform graph algorithms with r,c node ids
[X] - start creating a random maze (prims algorithm)
       [X] - offline: read about prims algorithm
[X] - Continue to work on prims
    - [x]Create getNeighbors helper fns as needed
[X] - prevent useless iterations in prims
[X] - choose a random start/end
[ ] - implement a dfs() fn
   - [X] implement plain jane dfs, with stack
   - [X] paint all nodes visited along the search  
   - [ ] try to paint nodes along path
        - TIP: return booleans in the dfs
[ ] - implement a bfs() fn
   - .... dfs did
