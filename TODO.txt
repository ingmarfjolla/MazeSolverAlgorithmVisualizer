       [X] - offline: read about prims algorithm
[X] - Continue to work on prims
    - [x]Create getNeighbors helper fns as needed
[ ] - prevent useless iterations in prims
[ ] - choose a random start/end
[ ] - implement a dfs() fn
   - [] implement plain jane dfs, with stack, try to paint nodes along path
